# install
         
to install the program you will need to go to build/libs and download the jar
then download the file 'alotoftext' (that's the file that holds all the words the program will use to generate the end result)
to the same path as the jar

# how to run it:

open your terminal and and go to your jar path then run the following

> java -jar DrawText-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

then a file chooser will pop up and you will need to choose an image (png,jpg...)
then it will ask you in the terminal if you want to draw with spaces ore with characters
enter 'y' are 'n' to choose
than it will generate the text file in folder 'ris' that will be in your jar path
